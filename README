Build Requirements
------------------

The following requirements need to be fulfilled in order to build the
application using a dist tarball:

* C++ compiler
* OpenSSL library and header files
* Doxygen (only if you plan on building the internal code documentation)

Packaging Requirements
----------------------

In order to build a dist tarball for the application the following external
software components need to be installed in addition to the build requirements
mentioned above:

* Boost library
* GNU Automake
* GNU Autoconf
* GNU Libtool

"make dist" extracts the following components from the Boost library (using
bcp):

* tr1
* smart_ptr
* bind
* function
* make_shared

These components are only used on the target system if your C++ compiler does
not at least support TR1 and there's no other system-wide installation of the
Boost library.

This program comes with its own Debian packaging scripts which may or may not
fully comply with the official Debian packaging requirements. These scripts can
be found in the 'debian' sub-directory. Binary packages can be built using
'dpkg-buildpackage'.
