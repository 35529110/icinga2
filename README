Build Requirements
------------------

The following requirements need to be fulfilled in order to build the
application using a dist tarball (package names in parenthesis):

* GNU make (make on RHEL and Debian)
* C++ compiler (gcc-c++ on RHEL, build-essential on Debian)
* OpenSSL library and header files (openssl-devel on RHEL, libssl-dev
                                    on Debian)
* Boost library and header files (boost-devel on RHEL, libboost-all-dev
                                  on Debian)
* optional: Doxygen (doxygen on RHEL and Debian)

Packaging Requirements
----------------------

In order to build a dist tarball for the application the following external
software components need to be installed in addition to the build requirements
mentioned above:

* GNU Automake (automake on RHEL and Debian)
* GNU Autoconf (autoconf on RHEL and Debian)
* GNU Libtool (libtool and libtool-ltdl-devel on RHEL, libtool and
               libltdl-dev on Debian)
* GNU bison (bison on RHEL and Debian)
* GNU flex (flex on RHEL and Debian)

Debian Packages
---------------

This program comes with its own Debian packaging scripts which may or may not
fully comply with the official Debian packaging requirements. These scripts can
be found in the 'debian' sub-directory. Binary packages can be built using
'dpkg-buildpackage'.
