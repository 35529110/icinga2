Icinga2 Demo Configuration Files
================================

This contains various config samples from the demo Team Icinga
did during the presentation at OSMC 2012.
http://www.slideshare.net/icinga/icinga-at-osmc-2012

You can use them to play around with the initial first release 0.0.1
of Icinga2 but remember that it might change later on, so this is
just kept for demo purposes.

For a more recent documentation on the configuration format please
check docs/ as well as the Icinga wiki at
