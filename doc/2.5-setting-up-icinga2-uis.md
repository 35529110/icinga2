## Setting up Icinga 2 User Interfaces

Icinga 2 is compatible to Icinga 1.x user interfaces by providing additional
features required as backends.

Furthermore these interfaces (and somewhere in the future an Icinga 2
exclusive interface) can be used for the newly created `Icinga Web 2`
user interface.

### Setting up Icinga Classic UI

Icinga 2 can write `status.dat` and `objects.cache` files in the format that
is supported by the Icinga 1.x Classic UI. External commands (a.k.a. the
"command pipe") are also supported. It also supports writing Icinga 1.x
log files which are required for the reporting functionality in the Classic UI.

#### Installing Icinga Classic UI

The Icinga package repository has both Debian and RPM packages. You can install
the Classic UI using the following packages:

  Distribution  | Packages
  --------------|---------------------
  Debian        | icinga2-classicui
  all others    | icinga2-classicui-config icinga-gui

> **Note**
>
> On all distributions other than Debian you may have to restart both your web
> server as well as Icinga 2 after installing the Classic UI package.

Verify that your Icinga 1.x Classic UI works by browsing to your Classic
UI installation URL:

  Distribution  | URL                                                                      | Default Login
  --------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------
  Debian        | [http://localhost/icinga2-classicui](http://localhost/icinga2-classicui) | asked during installation
  all others    | [http://localhost/icinga](http://localhost/icinga)                       | icingaadmin/icingaadmin


### Setting up Icinga Web

Icinga 2 can write to the same schema supplied by `Icinga IDOUtils 1.x` which
is an explicit requirement to run `Icinga Web` next to the external command pipe.
Therefore you need to setup the DB IDO feature remarked in the previous sections.

#### Installing Icinga Web

The Icinga package repository has both Debian and RPM packages. You can install
the Classic UI using the following packages:

  Distribution  | Packages
  --------------|-------------------------------------
  RHEL/SUSE     | icinga-web icinga-web-{mysql,pgsql}
  Debian        | icinga-web

Additionally you need to setup the `icinga_web` database.

> **Note**
>
> The Icinga Web RPM packages install the schema files into
> `/usr/share/doc/icinga-web-*/schema` (`*` means package version).
> The Icinga Web dist tarball ships the schema files in `etc/schema`.
>
> On SuSE-based distributions the schema files are installed in
> `/usr/share/doc/packages/icinga-web/schema`.


Additionally you need to enable the `ExternalCommandListener` feature.

    # icinga2-enable-feature command

Then edit the Icinga Web configuration for sending commands in `/etc/icinga-web/conf.d/access.xml`
(RHEL) or `/etc/icinga-web/access.xml` (SUSE) setting the command pipe path
to the default used in Icinga 2. Make sure to clear the cache afterwards.

    # vim /etc/icinga-web/conf.d/access.xml

                <write>
                    <files>
                        <resource name="icinga_pipe">/var/run/icinga2/cmd/icinga.cmd</resource>
                    </files>
                </write>

    # icinga-web-clearcache

Verify that your Icinga 1.x Web works by browsing to your Web installation URL:

  Distribution  | URL                                                         | Default Login
  --------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------
  Debian        | [http://localhost/icinga-web](http://localhost/icinga-web)  | asked during installation
  all others    | [http://localhost/icinga-web](http://localhost/icinga-web)  | root/password



### Setting up Icinga Web 2

Icinga Web 2 currently supports `status.dat`, `DB IDO` or `Livestatus` as backends.
Please consult the INSTALL documentation shipped with `Icinga Web 2` for
further instructions.

> **Note**
>
> Icinga Web 2 is still under heavy development. Rather than installing it
> yourself you should consider testing it using the available Vagrant
> demo boxes.

### Additional visualization

There are many addons in the wild which are using Icinga 1.x backends and
are well integrated into user interfaces.

The most famous ones are PNP or inGraph (graphing performance data), graphite, NagVis
(network maps), etc
