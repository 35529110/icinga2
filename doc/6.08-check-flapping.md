## <a id="check-flapping"></a> Check Flapping

The flapping algorithm used in Icinga 2 does not store the past states but
calculcates the flapping threshold from a single value based on counters and
half-life values. Icinga 2 compares the value with a single flapping threshold
configuration attribute named `flapping_threshold`.

Flapping detection can be enabled or disabled using the `enable_flapping` attribute.
