## <a id="check-flapping"></a> Check Flapping

The flapping algorithm used in Icinga 2 does not store the past states but
calculcates the flapping threshold from a single value based on counters and
half-life values. Icinga 2 compares the value with a single flapping threshold
configuration attribute named `flapping_threshold`.

> **Note**
>
> Flapping must be explicitely enabled setting the `Service` object attribute
> `enable_flapping = 1`.
