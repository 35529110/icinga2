## <a id="configuration-tools"></a> Configuration Tools

Well known configuration tools for Icinga 1.x such as [LConf](http://www.netways.de/en/de/produkte/icinga/addons/lconf/),
[NConf](http://www.nconf.org/) or [NagiosQL](http://www.nagiosql.org/)
store their configuration in a custom format in their backends (LDAP or RDBMS).
Currently only LConf 1.4.x supports Icinga 2 configuration export. If you require
your favourite configuration tool to export Icinga 2 configuration, please get in
touch with their developers.

If you're looking for puppet manifests, chef cookbooks, ansible recipes, etc - we're happy
to integrate them upstream, so please get in touch using [https://support.icinga.org](https://support.icinga.org) :-)
