## <a id="logging"></a> Logging

Icinga 2 supports three different types of logging:

* File logging
* Syslog (on *NIX-based operating systems)
* Console logging (`STDOUT` on tty)

You can enable additional loggers using the `icinga2-enable-feature`
and `icinga2-disable-feature` commands to configure loggers:

Feature  | Description
---------|------------
debuglog | Debug log (path: `/var/log/icinga2/debug.log`, severity: `debug` or higher)
mainlog  | Main log (path: `/var/log/icinga2/icinga2.log`, severity: `information` or higher)
syslog   | Syslog (severity: `warning` or higher)

By default file the `mainlog` feature is enabled. When running Icinga 2
on a terminal log messages with severity `information` or higher are
written to the console.
