## <a id="modified-attributes"></a> Modified Attributes

Icinga 2 allows you to modify defined object attributes at runtime different to
the local configuration object attributes. These modified attributes are
stored as bit-shifted-value and made available in backends. Icinga 2 stores
modified attributes in its state file and restores them on restart.

Modified Attributes can be reset using external commands.
