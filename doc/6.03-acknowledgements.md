## <a id="acknowledgements"></a> Acknowledgements

If a problem is alerted and notified you may signal the other notification
receipients that you are aware of the problem and will handle it.

By sending an acknowledgement to Icinga 2 (using the external command pipe
provided with `ExternalCommandListener` configuration) all future notifications
are suppressed, a new comment is added with the provided description and
a notification with the type `NotificationFilterAcknowledgement` is sent
to all notified users.

### <a id="expiring-acknowledgements"></a> Expiring Acknowledgements

Once a problem is acknowledged it may disappear from your `handled problems`
dashboard and no-one ever looks at it again since it will suppress
notifications too.

This `fire-and-forget` action is quite common. If you're sure that a
current problem should be resolved in the future at a defined time,
you can define an expiration time when acknowledging the problem.

Icinga 2 will clear the acknowledgement when expired and start to
re-notify if the problem persists.
