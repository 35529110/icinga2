icinga2 (0.0.3) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Icinga2 Debian packaging for snapshots

  *** Please note that at this point Icinga 2 is highly experimental software
  *** and is missing a significant portion of the planned features. This
  *** is merely a technology preview and if you're planning to set up
  *** a production environment for Icinga you should use Icinga 1.x instead.
